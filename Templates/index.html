        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I thrive in communities ü§ù. I'm a firm believer of the adage "if you want to go fast go alone. If you want to go far go together". While individual efforts may propel us forward momentarily, it's the collective strength of a community that sustains progress and propels us towards enduring success. Within these communities, I've witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of mentorship, guidance, and shared knowledge.</p>

At Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Club, I take part in helping fellow students navigate their way in the field of data through regular meetups of solving data challenges. At Equity Leaders Program, I take pride in cheering on and encouraging high school students to do their best in academics and to be people of value in the society. At MLSA Kenya, we advocate for inclusivity in innovation by reaching out to various people and sharing resources to help them adapt to cutting-edge technology. We are a force for good!</p>

That play comes in the form of football a sport that's more than just a game; it's a passion that ignites my spirit and fuels my drive. In the midst of busy schedules and demanding tasks, football serves as my sanctuary.</p>
